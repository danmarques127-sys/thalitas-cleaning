    <p>
      Cooking brings warmth and flavor to your home â€” but it also brings a mess. Over time, grease splatters from
      frying, sautÃ©ing, or boiling can build up on your stove, creating a sticky film thatâ€™s hard to remove.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this guide, weâ€™ll show you exactly how to remove grease from your stove, which cleaning products actually
      work, and how to keep your kitchen sparkling clean every day.

      Step-by-Step: How to Remove Stove Grease Properly

      </div>
      <p>
        Safety first! Always make sure your stove is completely cool and unplugged before cleaning. This prevents burns
        and avoids damage to sensitive parts.

        <span>Remove Grates, Burners, and Knobs</span>
      </div>
      <p>Take off any removable parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gas stoves:</strong> remove metal grates and burner caps.</li>
        <li><strong>Electric stoves:</strong> remove the coils carefully (if possible).</li>
        <li><strong>Glass-top stoves:</strong> skip this step.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Soak all removable parts in a sink or tub filled with hot, soapy water. Let them sit for 15â€“30 minutes to loosen
        grease and food residue.

        <span>Apply Baking Soda to Greasy Areas</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Sprinkle baking soda over the worst spots. It acts as a gentle scrub that wonâ€™t scratch your stoveâ€™s surface.
        For caked-on grease, make a paste using <strong>3 parts baking soda + 1 part water</strong>.

        <span>Spray Vinegar and Let It Fizz</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Fill a spray bottle with equal parts white vinegar and warm water. Spray directly onto the baking soda â€” youâ€™ll
        see fizzing, which means itâ€™s breaking down the grease naturally. Let it sit for
        <strong>5â€“10 minutes</strong> to dissolve grime.

      <p>
        Use a sponge, microfiber cloth, or brush to scrub the surface in circular motions. Avoid steel wool or scouring
        pads that can scratch the surface. For corners and knobs, use an old toothbrush.

        Wipe everything down with a clean damp cloth, then dry with paper towels or a microfiber towel to avoid streaks.
        Make sure the area is completely dry before placing parts back on the stove.
